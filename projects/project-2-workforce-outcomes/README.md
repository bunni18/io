#The Problem: "Public service programs lack a centralized view of per-capita spending, making it difficult to reallocate budget to high-demand areas."

The Technical Solution: "I built a relational schema in MySQL (hosted on Aiven) with referential integrity to prevent 'ghost enrollments' (orphaned records)."

The Data Insight: Paste the table results from the query you just ran.

The Conclusion: "Based on the data, the Rental Assistance Program represents the highest per-capita cost, suggesting a need for long-term housing policy review rather than just short-term aid."
